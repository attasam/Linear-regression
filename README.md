Linear Regression with Stochastic Gradient Decent 

Start by creating a housing prices dataset with just one feature (area of the house) 
Initialize parameter values at random 
Set your alpha parameter 
Run gradient descent algorithm by updating theta values until the gradient becomes less than 0.01. 
Report the final values of theta that can be used to make predictions 
Make predictions on some test set as well (and compute MSE on it) 
Visualize the theta values changing over iterations.
